# ARE_proximity
Code to test whether genes regulated by androgens have more/fewer AREs proximal to their TSS than the genome-wide average

ARE_gene_intersection.txt gives BASH code to count the number of androgen response elements within 100kb of each gene TSS
ARE_gene_intersection_function.R gives function that tests whether the number of AREs proximal to androgen-regulated genes differs from the genome-wide average and ggplot code to make figures
